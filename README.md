# Reflection: The Gaming Room Software Design Document

### Client and Software Requirements
The client, The Gaming Room, required a software design for a gaming application that allows users to compete across platforms while maintaining scalability and flexibility. The project focused on designing a system that supported multiplayer gameplay.

### Strengths in Documentation Development
I excelled in clearly outlining the architecture and ensuring that the document was easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Insights Gained From the Process
Working through the design document was helpful because it forced me to think critically about the software's structure before diving into coding, saving time and reducing errors later.

### Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise one part of my documentation, I would enhance the visuals, such as diagrams and charts, to provide a clearer representation of the architecture.

### User Needs Interpretation
I carefully interpreted the client’s needs by engaging with their requirements and translating them into a user-friendly design. Understanding the user’s perspective is crucial to building software that meets expectations.

### Software Design Approach
My design approach included breaking the project into components, using UML diagrams, and focusing on modularity. In future projects, I would incorporate more iterative feedback sessions to refine the design.
