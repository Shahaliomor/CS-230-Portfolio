# Reflection: The Gaming Room Software Design Document

### Client and Software Requirements
The client, The Gaming Room, aimed to develop a web-based distributed platform for their game, **Draw It or Lose It**. The primary goal was to extend their existing Android-based game to support multiple platforms while ensuring scalability, unique naming conventions, and efficient game session management. The design incorporated software patterns like Singleton and Iterator to meet these technical and business requirements.

### Strengths in Documentation Development
I excelled at clearly defining the system's architecture and integrating software design principles like modularity and scalability. The document effectively communicates the design to both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring alignment across all parties.

### Insights Gained From the Process
Developing the design document was instrumental in understanding how to structure software for distributed systems. It helped me foresee potential issues, such as data conflicts, and plan solutions like the Singleton pattern to ensure centralized game data management.

### Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise one part of the document, it would be the **System Architecture View**. Adding detailed diagrams and logical topologies would make the architecture easier to visualize for all stakeholders. This improvement would clarify the relationships between system components.

### User Needs Interpretation
The userâ€™s need for a seamless, multi-platform experience was a central focus. For example, ensuring unique game and team names directly addressed user concerns about data integrity. Understanding and implementing user needs is crucial for creating functional and user-friendly software.

### Software Design Approach
I approached the design by:
- Breaking the project into manageable components, such as the GameService and Entity classes.
- Utilizing UML diagrams to visualize relationships between objects.
- Applying design patterns like Singleton and Iterator for efficiency.

In the future, I would incorporate more iterative feedback from stakeholders to refine designs incrementally and ensure alignment with user expectations.
